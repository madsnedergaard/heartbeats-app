# The unofficial Heartbeats Radio App

I love Heartbeats, but were missing features from the website - thus this app was created.

## Features

- Support for keyboard media-controls (play/pause)
- Fixes issues with the stream stopping after a while and requiring reload
- Standalone app (no more searching for the right tab in your browser!)

## Getting started

1. Install `electron-packager` globally:

```
npm install -g electron-packager
```

2. Run build script:

```
npm run build
```


3. Done

_This app is not in any way affiliated with Heartbeats - I'm just a huge fan!_
