# The unofficial Heartbeats App

**--- WARNING (27/09-17) ---**

Currently not working as Heartbeats have changed their website/feed and it's not yet possible to play any beats.. Hopefully I'll get it working again soon.

**--- WARNING ---**


I love [Heartbeats](http://heartbeats.dk/), but listening from the website had some drawbacks - thus this desktop app was created.

## Get it right here:
