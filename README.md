# The unofficial Heartbeats App

I love Heartbeats, but listening from the website had some drawbacks - thus this app was created.

## Features

- Support for keyboard media-controls (play/pause)
- Fixes issues with the stream stopping after a while and requiring reload
- Standalone app (no more searching for the right tab in your browser!)

## Upcoming features

- Local caching of podcasts
- Scrobbling
- Chromecast support

If you want to help out making this app awesome I would love your help! Feel free to contact me or just go crazy with issues and pull requests :)

## Build

Wanna build the release yourself or contribute?

1. Install `electron-packager` globally:

```
npm install -g electron-packager
```

2. Run build script:

```
npm run build
```

3. Either start development or create release:

```
npm run start
```

or create a new release:

```
npm run release
```
